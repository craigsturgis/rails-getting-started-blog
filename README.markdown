#Rails getting started code by numbers

This is the commit by commit version of me following along with the [Rails Gettings Started Guide][1]. Learn by doing, even when it produces something really simple. Honestly, I feel like I do understand the simple guts and philosophy of rails better after having done this and having done commits at each step.
